# Progress

## What Works

- Memory bank initialization and documentation setup are complete.
- Project structure (frontend and backend folders) is in place.

## What's Left to Build

- Frontend UI for cover letter input and feedback display.
- Core text analysis logic for grammar, style, and tone.
- Feedback generation and integration with the frontend.
- (Potentially) Cover letter scoring/rating feature.

## Current Status

Currently in the initial setup and documentation phase. Core memory bank documentation is initialized and updated with project details. Project architecture and technology stack are defined. Backend API endpoint for receiving cover letter text is implemented. Moving to the next phase of implementing the backend logic and frontend UI.

## Known Issues

No known issues at this stage.
