# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Text Analysis:**  Potentially libraries like Natural or similar for NLP tasks (to be decided).
- **Documentation:** Markdown
- **Version Control:** Git

## Development Setup

- **IDE:** VSCode (recommended)
- **Node.js and npm:** Required for backend and frontend development.
- **Angular CLI:**  For frontend development and project scaffolding.
- **Git:** For version control.

## Technical Constraints

- Initial focus will be on basic text analysis without advanced NLP features due to time constraints.
- The accuracy of feedback will depend on the complexity of the analysis logic implemented.
- Performance might be a consideration if the text analysis becomes computationally intensive.

## Dependencies

- **Frontend Dependencies:** Managed by npm (package.json in frontend/).
- **Backend Dependencies:** Managed by npm (package.json in backend/).
- Use `npm install` to install dependencies in both frontend and backend directories.
