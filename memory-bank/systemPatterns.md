# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The system will follow a client-server architecture. 

- **Frontend:** An Angular frontend will handle user interaction, allowing users to input cover letter text and view feedback.
- **Backend:** A Node.js backend using Express will process the cover letter text, perform analysis, and provide feedback to the frontend.

The frontend and backend will communicate via REST API.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Choosing Angular for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Selecting Node.js and Express for the backend due to their ease of use and suitability for building APIs.
- Using Markdown for memory bank documentation to maintain project knowledge.

## Design Patterns

- **REST API:**  Using RESTful principles for communication between frontend and backend to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- **Modular Design:**  Structuring both frontend and backend into modules for better organization and code reusability.

## Component Relationships

1. User inputs cover letter text in the Angular frontend.
2. Frontend sends a request to the backend API with the cover letter text.
3. Backend receives the text, processes it using text analysis logic.
4. Backend generates feedback and sends it back to the frontend as a JSON response.
5. Frontend displays the feedback to the user.
