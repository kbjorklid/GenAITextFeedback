# Active Context

## Current Focus

Currently focusing on setting up the project structure and initializing the memory bank documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the memory bank with core files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md.
- Updated projectbrief.md and productContext.md with initial project details.

## Next Steps

Next steps include:
- Define the system architecture and document it in systemPatterns.md.
- Choose the technologies and development setup, and document them in techContext.md.
- Start outlining the core logic for cover letter analysis in the backend.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Deciding on the specific metrics and criteria for evaluating cover letters.
- Choosing the most appropriate libraries or tools for text analysis.
- Considering whether to start with a simple rule-based approach or explore more advanced NLP techniques.
