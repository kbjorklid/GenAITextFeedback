# Product Context

## Problem

Job seekers often struggle to write effective cover letters that showcase their skills and experience in a compelling way. Many lack confidence in their writing abilities and find it difficult to tailor their cover letters to specific job requirements. This often results in generic, unpersuasive cover letters that fail to capture the attention of hiring managers.

## Solution

This project aims to develop a cover letter evaluator tool that helps users write better cover letters. The tool will analyze cover letter text and provide feedback on grammar, style, tone, and overall effectiveness. By identifying areas for improvement, the tool empowers users to refine their cover letters and increase their chances of getting noticed by employers.

## User Experience Goals

The tool should offer a simple and intuitive user interface. Users should be able to easily input their cover letter text and receive clear, actionable feedback in a timely manner. The feedback should be constructive and guide users on how to improve specific aspects of their writing. The tool should be accessible and user-friendly for individuals with varying levels of technical skills.

## Target Users

The primary target users are job seekers across various industries and experience levels. This includes students, recent graduates, experienced professionals, and individuals seeking career changes. The tool can also be beneficial for career counselors, resume writers, and educational institutions that provide career services.
